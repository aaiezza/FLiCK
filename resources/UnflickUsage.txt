* Compressed FASTA/Q file detection is currently limited to detecting
    file extensions .flickfa and .flickfq respectively within a .flick file.

EXAMPLES:
  unflick --delete --verbose Dmel_research.flick
    >> Decompress the 'Dmel_research.flick' and delete the flick file
         and tell me all about it.
         All .flickfa/q files (compressed FASTA/Q files) will be inflated as well.

  unflick -d GCF_000001405.28_GRCh38.p2_genomic.fna.flickfa
    >> Decompress the file GCF_000001405.28_GRCh38.p2_genomic.fna.flickfa
         then delete it leaving GCF_000001405.28_GRCh38.p2_genomic.fna

  unflick SRR304976.fq.flick
    >> Decompress SRR304976.fq.flick to SRR304976.fq
